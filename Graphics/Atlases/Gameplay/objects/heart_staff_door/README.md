# Heart Staff Door Icons

This folder should contain icons for the Heart Staff Door display.

## Required Files

Create icon images for each staff slot on the door:
- `icon00.png` - First staff icon
- `icon01.png` - Second staff icon  
- `icon02.png` - Third staff icon
- ... up to `icon06.png`

Or use a single icon that will be tinted per staff color.

## Size

Icons should be approximately 32x32 pixels.

## Fallback

If no icons are found, the system falls back to using `objects/heart_spear_door_mod/icon` textures,
or simple colored circles.
